Music Player


Introduction

This code is a simple music player built using Python and the Pygame library. 
It allows users to select songs from a directory and play, stop, pause, and unpause the selected song.


Key Concepts

Pygame: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. 
	It provides functionality for handling multimedia, including sound and music playback.
Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
	It provides a set of tools for creating graphical user interfaces.
askdirectory: The askdirectory function from the tkinter.
	filedialog module opens a dialog box that allows the user to select a directory.
Listbox: The Listbox widget from Tkinter is used to display a list of items. 
	In this code, it is used to display the list of songs in the selected directory.
Buttons: The Button widget from Tkinter is used to create buttons that perform specific actions when clicked. 
	In this code, buttons are used to play, stop, pause, and unpause the selected song.
StringVar: The StringVar class from Tkinter is used to create a variable that can be used to display text in a label widget.


Code Structure

Import the necessary libraries: pygame, tkinter, and os.
Create an instance of the Tkinter Tk class to create the main window for the music player.
Set the title and geometry of the main window.
Use the askdirectory function to open a dialog box and allow the user to select a directory.
Change the current working directory to the selected directory.
Get the list of songs in the selected directory using the os.listdir function.
Create a Listbox widget to display the list of songs.
Insert each song from the song list into the Listbox widget.
Initialize the Pygame library for sound and music playback.
Define functions for playing, stopping, pausing, and unpausing the selected song.
Create buttons for each action and associate them with the corresponding functions.
Create a StringVar variable to display the title of the currently playing song.
Create a label widget to display the song title.
Pack all the widgets into the main window.
Start the main event loop using the mainloop method of the Tk class.
Code Examples
Here are some code examples to illustrate how the music player works:

Playing a Song:

def play():
    pygame.mixer.music.load(play_list.get(tkr.ACTIVE))
    var.set(play_list.get(tkr.ACTIVE))
    pygame.mixer.music.play()
When the "PLAY" button is clicked, this function is called. 
It loads the selected song from the Listbox widget using the get method and sets the StringVar variable to the selected song. 
Then, it uses the play method of the pygame.mixer.music module to play the selected song.

Stopping the Song:

def stop():
    pygame.mixer.music.stop()
When the "STOP" button is clicked, this function is called. 
It stops the currently playing song using the stop method of the pygame.mixer.music module.

Pausing the Song:

def pause():
    pygame.mixer.music.pause()
When the "PAUSE" button is clicked, this function is called. 
It pauses the currently playing song using the pause method of the pygame.mixer.music module.

Unpausing the Song:

def unpause():
    pygame.mixer.music.unpause()
When the "UNPAUSE" button is clicked, this function is called. 
It unpauses the currently paused song using the unpause method of the pygame.mixer.music module.

Conclusion
This code demonstrates how to create a simple music player using Python and the Pygame library. 
It allows users to select songs from a directory and play, stop, pause, and unpause the selected song. 
By understanding the key concepts and code structure, you can customize and enhance the music player according to your needs.
